            About Me Software Developer with a background in C#, Python, Java,
            and Javascript. I enjoy coding, tabletop games, hiking, as well as
            playing and creating video games. Throughout my prior workplaces,
            I've stayed productive under pressure to mitigate problems before
            they become a crisis, help myself and others control emotional work
            stress, and value transparency and communication above all else.
